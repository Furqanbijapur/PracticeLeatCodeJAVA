# DSA Solutions Repository

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various DSA problems from popular coding platforms like **LeetCode** and **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**. The aim of this repository is to document my problem-solving journey, share knowledge, and help others in their coding preparation.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
The solutions are organized by platform and further categorized by topic or difficulty level. Below is the folder structure:

```
root
├── LeetCode
│   ├── Easy
│   ├── Medium
│   ├── Hard
├── GFG
│   ├── Arrays
│   ├── LinkedList
│   ├── Trees
│   ├── Graphs
│   
└── README.md
```

Each folder contains solutions in the respective programming language and is named after the problem.
